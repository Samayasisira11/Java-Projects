This repository contains a set of beginner-friendly Java projects demonstrating fundamental programming 
concepts such as loops, conditionals, arrays, user input handling, random number generation, 
and file I/O operations. Each project is simple, interactive, and helps strengthen core Java skills.
Projects Included

1. ATM.java — ATM Simulation
A console-based ATM system that allows users to:
Withdraw money
Deposit money
Check account balance
Exit the system
It mimics basic ATM functionality using loops, conditionals, and user input validation.

2. GuessTheNumberGame.java — Number Guessing Game
A fun interactive game where:
The computer generates a random number
The user tries to guess it within 10 attempts
Hints (too high / too low) guide the user
The program tracks rounds and calculates average attempts
It demonstrates random number generation, loops, and basic game logic.

3. TicTacToe.java — Two-Player Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns placing X and O.
Features include:
Input validation
Win detection across rows, columns, and diagonals
Tie checking when the board is full
Board representation using a 2D array
This project highlights array manipulation and game-loop implementation.

4. WordCountProgram.java — Word Counter Tool
A text-processing utility that:
Accepts input from the user OR reads text from a file
Splits the text into words using delimiters
Displays the total word count
It demonstrates file handling (BufferedReader), string processing, and input handling.
